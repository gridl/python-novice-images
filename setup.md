## Installing Python Using Anaconda

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages
individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one
installer [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda).

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python
version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine). Also, please set up your python environment at 
least a day in advance of the workshop.  If you encounter problems with the 
installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

### Windows - [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)

1. Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads#_windows) with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.

3. Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using _MOST_ of the 
   default settings. The only exception is to check the 
   **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.

### Mac OS X - [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U)

1. Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads#_macosx) with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.

3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux
Note that the following installation steps require you to work from the shell. 
If you run into any difficulties, please request help before the workshop begins.

1.  Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads#_unix) with your web browser.

2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
    
3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

    a.  Open a terminal window.

    b.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the installer

    c.  Type

    ~~~
    $ bash Anaconda3-
    ~~~
    {: .source}

    and press tab.  The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.

    d.  Press enter.
    
    e.  Follow the text-only prompts.  When the license agreement appears (a colon
        will be present at the bottom of the screen) hold the down arrow until the bottom of the text.
        Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press enter again to approve the
        default location for the files. Type `yes` and press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).

## Starting Python

We will teach Python using the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that
runs in a web browser. Jupyter requires a reasonably up-to-date browser, preferably
a current version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox (note that Internet Explorer version 9
and below are *not* supported). If you installed Python using Anaconda, Jupyter should already
be on your system. If you did not use Anaconda, use the Python package manager pip.
([See the Jupyter website for details](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#optional-for-experienced-python-developers-installing-jupyter-with-pip))

To start the notebook, open a terminal or git bash and type the command:

~~~
$ jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .source}

To start the Python interpreter without the notebook, open a terminal or git bash and type the command:

~~~
$ python
~~~
{: .source}
